Brief notes on how to convert midi into something useable by uzebox 
on a Linux host system.

* Start with a standard midi song
* Open it with rosegarden
* Reduce the tracks to 4 or less (preferably 2)
* The uzebox doesn't support polyphony, so try and eliminate tracks that have it.
* Remove all markers from the file
* Create markers S (start) and E (end) at the start and end of the song
* Save the resulting file (midi export)
* Convert the file from midi type 1 to type 0 (wine ./tools/gn1to0.exe, "
* Convert the midi file to an uzebox patch file:
    java -cp uzetools.jar \
        com.belogic.uzebox.tools.converters.midi.MidiConvert \
        -f 6.5 input.mid output.h)
