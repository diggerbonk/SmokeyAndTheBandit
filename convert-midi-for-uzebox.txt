How to create a music patch file

* Find a midi song
* Open it with rosegarden (import)
* Reduce the tracks to 4 or less
** Remember that the uzebox doesn't support polyphany within a channel, so try to pick channels that only play one note at time. 
** Remove existing markers.
** Create markers S (start) and E (end) at the start and end of the song.
** Save the resulting midi file (export)
* Convert the file from midi type 1 to type 0 (wine /home/trent/Downloads/gn1to0.exe)
* Convert teh midi file to an uzebox patch file (java -cp /home/trent/Downloads/uzetools.jar com.belogic.uzebox.tools.converters.midi.MidiConvert -f 6 input.mid output.h)
