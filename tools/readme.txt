==============================
GN1:0 MIDI Converter Freeware
      G. Nagler (c) 2004
==============================


[1] PURPOSE

GN1:0 is a Windows software (95/98/ME/2000/XP)
that is able to convert MIDI files in format 0 or 1 to formats 
0 or 1. That is necessary when MIDI devices only accept one of
these formats (often format 0 only).
This software reads .mid, .kar and .rmi files and creates
.mid files. Some most important MIDI file information is collected
from MIDI file content and displayed in a window.
Beside the conversion facilities it can play MIDI files on your 
MIDI device including display of synchronized song text on screen.

Second purpose of this program is to present more comfortable and 
mightier MIDI tools, that can do this task too  
(e.g. convert format of all MIDI files in a folder at once)
additionally to many more other facilities.
The additional features are not available in this software, you find
them in Shareware GNMIDI. You may read descriptions to interesting 
GNMIDI operations in integrated help.
When you are interested you may try demo programs GNMIDI or GNMIDFMT 
without costs for some days and if you like it then you may register
the shareware in future when you register which costs a one time not 
expensive registration fee payment and gives you permission to use
the shareware program without demo limits.

[2] DISCLAIMER

GN1:0 was designed to handle 100% compatible standard MIDI files.
So I give no guarantees of the results, especially with non 100% 
compatible MIDI files.
If you find a MIDI file that you think to be 100% compatible MIDI
that is not correctly converted, please send a sample file to 
info@gnmidi.com

[7] USAGE
Start gn1to0.exe and then load a MIDI file (.mid, .kar, .rmi) using operation "Open file".
A new window appears that displays some information about the MIDI file.
Here you find also the information about MIDI file format (0, 1, 2).
In toolbar you find some activated buttons, among them a "0" or "1" button depending on 
the MIDI file. Same functions are also available in menu.
Clicking one of these buttons starts conversion of MIDI file format into a new temporary MIDI file.
A new window appears for this MIDI file with modified information (format, tracks, size ...).
Now you may save the result into a new file using operation "save as ...". 
You should overwrite your original file only if you are sure that you have archived a backup of 
the original file, since during conversion some information is lost due to differences in file formats. 
einige Informationen verloren, die Sie nur in der Originaldatei später wiederfinden würden. You can only
get this lost information only back from your original file.
You can start and stop MIDI playing with space key and lower half of window displays karaoke song text
(if available). You can select an alternative MIDI device for playing inside the settings menu.

If you are interested, what the many existing GNMIDI operations can do (even the ones that are not 
enabled in this free program), then you can read about these mighty operations in integrated help pages.
Move the mouse cursor above an interesting button or menu entry and click key F1 to start the GNMIDI help
page to this operation.

In help menu you find also a link to GNMIDI homepage where you could download the program demos and 
try them for some days without payment. At GNMIDI homepage you find also many information to the programs
(operation summary, operation list, online manual, screenshots, prices).
