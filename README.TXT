Smokey and the Bandit for Uzebox Jamma
--------------------------------------

Create an 80's era arcade machine tie-in for the car chase classic 
Smokey and the Bandit? It ain't never been done before, hot shit.

No LCD's, no 3D, no high resolution graphics or surround sound. Just a 
full 8 bits of twitch gameplay. Sandwiched between a Ms. Pac Man and 
Galaga machine it looks right at home.

GAMEPLAY

You're The Bandit, a pixelized black 1977 Trans-Am. Your task is simple 
enough: collect all the Coors you can while avoiding obstacles. You get 
points for collecting Coors cans, for executing turns on backcountry 
roads, and for jumping over obstacles. The faster you go, the more 
points you earn. Over time the course gets longer, the speed gets 
faster, and the placement of Coors and obstacles becomes more erratic.

HARDWARE

Uzebox, an 8 bit retro game system. 240x224 screen resolution. 4K RAM. 

CABINET

We used a reproduction Midway style cabinet, ordered from 
arcadeshop.com, and then we teamed with Trademark Sign company on the 
graphics. The marquee and bezel are reverse screenprinted 3/16" inch 
tempered glass. The control panel and sides are wrapped in a durable, 
textured product that resembles faux leather. We put in a 19" CRT, 
old-school leaf buttons and joystick, and of course it takes quarters.
